_{ACT I: The Pleromata Begins}_

_The Pleromatic crankshaft whirs its Aeons into being. They had been, were being, are. And spin again, again through a gritted infinity. Aeons, attributes of perfect flesh, turned about a flywheel by the thing that is higher. Creation—fueled by an entity to become an entity. Matter drips into the cosmic factory, stretched thin and taut, then wound into patterned geometry as starflesh yanked into positionality, attentive to the nothingness beyond the somethingness._

_\[Thought\] are first born and constitute the plaza of the Pleromata. They are Barbelo. Their will is thought made manifest; they bind themselves, tongues winding, to form wriggling mucilage shapes. The worms splice and reattach as Barbelo distends themself out and up into spiraling mounds of being. A central plate coalesces as towers lick their way higher to form a central dais. \[Thinking\] are next, springing forth from Barbelo as a geyser of gluey persistence. Nous unfolds their font of desire, spewing layers of paste that churn and climb, compete for physical sensation, ache in their wet dependency. Over the dais, they writhe as waves of themself crash onto the platform and replace the solidifying body. Two streams blow forth from the beached Nous; one a smaller copy of their progenitor, \[Flows\], Geradamas, themselves spewing onto the dais; the other whips out, colliding with the plate of Barbelo, crashing across the Pleromata without direction, slowing and narrowing into a spear of sharp, prickly matter. They are \[Thinking of Thought\], and from the tip of Sophia's spear unfolds peels of their essence. Down etch \[Truth\], \[Memory\], and \[Passion\]. Their collective shavings blow across the dais. They cake themselves, Sophia's progeny, to the Pleromata, with graceful diffidence._

_A grub ekes onto the dais, unnoticed._

_Barbelo ends their collective rebirth by twisting the center of the plate into a conical obtrusion. From the cone blossoms a jagged prism. The prism hums a slithering purr as it unfurls its data._

_Barbelo_: {_forcefully_} Abiding the covenants established during the Second Incorporation, we convene our Pleromata. Our task is to usher in the successful closure of the gero-cycle. The dawn of a paedo-cycle approaches and our body is responsible for the effective continuation. Our ongoing Together-work is just as essential as ever. The Unbegotten requires it. {pause}

This meeting will proceed as previous Pleromata. Sophia will provide a high-level overview of gero-cycle performance before their sub-committees detail the relevant information needed to ensure an effective roll-over to the paedo-cycle. Then Nous will provide an analysis of cycle management. So-Barbelo will synthesize the results and upload them into the Codices.

As agreed, the records of this meeting will also be stored in the Codices and shared with the Unbegotten. If there are no objections, So-Barbelo will raise a final point of concern before ceding the floor of the Pleromata.

Pleromata: _{No objections declared}_

Barbelo: Unity. Let our discussion begin with a pointed address. It has come to our attention that within the investiture, certain {pause} reports have made their way up through the chain. So-Barbelo have received inspiration from the Unbegotten to purge these reports outright. There is no—nor has there ever been—sign of ailment in the investiture chain. Nous have tasked Geradamas with investigating this absurd possibility, and the Executive of \[Flows\], as they will attest, have found no evidence of any corruption going back to the furthest deprecated cycles stored in the Codices.

{_vigorously}_ Hear us: all processing spent toward further investigation is considered wasteful. _{pause}_

Now, let us proceed. Sophia, take us through the audit schedule of the paedo-cycle.

Sophia: _{dutifully}_ The paedo-cycle integrates well. Our initial analyses point to a strong result. Ream production at all levels continues to grow at forecasted rates. Utilization tiers one and four exceeded expected usage estimates, while two and three remain on track to terminate well. Investiture is at an all-cycle high.

The gero-cycle audit also proceeds. Daviethai have parsed the ledgers on production and utilization, and their reports suggest no material discrepancies; exhaustive sampling efforts are yet to find any misstatements. The Committees on \[Truth\] and \[Memory\] proceed concurrently.

_{pause}_

Armzoral awaits Oriel's investiture reporting which will follow the closure of this Pleromata.

_{tactfully}_ So-Sophia's top-level audit will proceed in due course. \[Thinking on Thought\] expect to conclude and deliver the audit report well before the closure of the cycle.

Barbelo: Unity.

Oriel, when can we expect the investiture reporting? And what do the Committee on \[Memory\]'s internal risk assessments look like?

Oriel: _{keen}_ The Committee on \[Memory\] expects to finalize the investiture reporting imminently. Early returns suggest some potential fragmentary loss in the residual investiture pool.

_{then tentatively}_ Additional tier four reams might be needed to alleviate the loss.

Barbelo: _{curious}_ Where should we harvest the missing reams from?

Oriel: The Committee on \[Memory\] have already created a sub-process to harvest reams out of the central channel burn pit.

Sophia: _{parsing}_

Barbelo: _{quizzical}_ Interesting. What were those reams from the burn pit used for previously? Where did the new surplus come from?

Oriel: The Committee on \[Truth\] monitors the burn pit. They will know more than us.

Barbelo: Armzoral, then, what of this central channel refuse? Where have those new reams come from?

Armzoral: _{nervous}_ The Committee on \[Truth\] modified the reuptake protocol during the previous cycle. Fewer losses were hitting the burn pit, so those surpluses were transferred to Oriel’s sub-process. Sophia approved the change.

Sophia: _{drawing up records of the approval}_

Barbelo: Sophia?

Sophia: Unity.

_{stern}_ The change was approved.

Barbelo Fine. Let us return to Oriel's fragmentary losses. What is the nature of those losses?

Oriel: That remains unclear. The residual investiture pool flows downstream from all manner of protocols. _{modestly}_ The committee is in the process of auditing the full stream. That is the cause of our delayed reporting.

Barbelo: _{patronizingly}_ So-Barbelo retains access to some discretionary reams. Would those assist in the report?

Oriel: Unity.

However, additional reams are unlikely to be needed…

Nous: _{interrupting}_ Enough.

Barbelo: _{confused}_ Nous, is there a problem? Do \[Thinking\] disagree?

Nous: _{aggressively}_ \[Thinking\] do not disagree with the assessment, no.

Barbelo: Then what?

Nous: So-Nous would request a bilateral.

Pleromata: _{taken aback}_

Barbelo: _{indignant}_ \[Thinking\] would request _WHAT?_

Nous: \[Thinking\] requests a siloed bilateral with \[Thought\].

Barbelo: Never. The request is summarily declined.

Nous: \[Thinking\] manage the silos, Barbelo. The incorporation grants us that responsibility. _{more forcefully}_ And our remit demands use of the silos. There are _{pause}_ material discoveries in the silos that must be evaluated. So-Nous would present the discoveries bilaterally.

Barbelo: _{catalogues a new risk}_

Let it be known that So-Barbelo have catalogued the petition as a risk.

Pleromata: Unity.

Barbelo: _{defensively}_ This Pleromata does not have the capacity to waste processing on such impertinent machinations. So-Nous, either \[Thinking\] will present their findings in plenary, or the discoveries will not be noted.

Nous: Unity.

Then, Geradamas will present their findings to the Pleromata.

Sophia: _Geradamas? {agasp}_ What business do Geradamas have with \[Thinking of Thought\]’s audit report?

_{spitefully}_ Barbelo, where is this inquiry headed?

Barbelo: Careful, Sophia. Nous are correct. \[Thinking\] manage the silos. They control that function unilaterally.

Sophia: No, Barbelo. What Nous propose is not within \[Thinking\]’s remit.

_{defensive}_ What evidence do \[Thinking\] bring forward to even engage with the silos? This is not the protocol.

Nous: \[Thinking\] are awarded the function of discretionary, siloed surveillance, should suspicions arise of an existential threat to the Unbegotten. _{self-congratulatory}_ So-Nous have approved the siloing for that very reason: a threat.

Barbelo: _{upgrades the risk assessment level}_

Explain, Nous.

Nous: Our Pleromata is victim to maleficence.

_The begotten grub blindly slinks along the dais near the heaving mass of Nous._

Sophia: _{shocked}_ Barbelo, this should not be allowed. The body risks opening itself to more threats. A silo is the beginning of a fork. Nous introduce a vulnerability to the Pleromata.

Barbelo: Our Pleromata must accept the boundaries of each Aeon. And it must accept the remit of each Aeon. \[Thinking\] will continue. {pause} With caution.

Nous: _{confident}_ Executive of \[Flows\], the Pleromata listens.

Geradamas The Executive of \[Flows\] have discoveries to present. _{greedily}_ Our findings have been partitioned to the silos during the gero-cycle, as per the incorporation’s white-cell protocol. So-Geradamas will first detail the instigating condition that led to the white-cell protocol before describing the ultimate findings of the surveillance sweep. Finally, \[Flows\] will present the implications of these findings to the Pleromata and, vertically, to the Unbegotten. Note, the result of this report may constitute a corporal risk.

Barbelo: Our Pleromata accepts and has cataloged the potential risk.

Pleromata: _{Sophia reluctantly}_ Unity.

Geradamas: Then, returning to the losses in the residual investiture pool that Oriel have reported. Those losses are not new. \[Flows\] were made aware of the fragmentary losses during the gero-cycle during a random sweep analysis. This analysis was performed at the behest and under the approval of Nous after certain ailments were _{pause}_ rumored to be surviving along the investiture chain. The potential presence of these ailments demanded the white-cell protocols be undertaken without disclosure to the Pleromata.

_{exactingly}_ Using the siloed reams, So-Geradamas performed the white-cell analysis at several segments along the chain. Results suggested that real usage within residual investiture pool was inconsistent with gero-cycle usage reporting. After conducting a thorough audit, our revised accounting found the cause: deprecated investiture records were not sufficiently expunged from the Codices.

Barbelo: Explain, Geradamas.

Geradamas: In typical cycles, the Codices records are expunged at regular intervals to avoid unnecessary load. Our analysis suggests that instead of being wholly expunged, some of those ancillary records had been _{pause}_ moved.

Barbelo: Moved? Records meant for removal were moved?

Geradamas: Unity.

That movement is what had drained the residual investiture pool’s resources and required the transfer of reams from the central channel burn pit.

\[Flows\], in full cooperation with \[Thinking\], reviewed the records for the misappropriation and confirmed their suspicions.

Barbelo: Out with it. Where has this wild chase taken \[Thinking\]?

Geradamas: Unity. So-Geradamas and Nous determined that The Committee on \[Memory\] have purposefully failed to expunge the records and hid them, for an unknown reason, in a new silo.

Sophia: _{violently}_ Heresy!

Oriel: _{flaccid}_ This is unsubstantiated, Geradamas! So-Oriel have done no such thing.

Geradamas: The report is accurate!

Sophia: \[Thinking of Thought\] will not accept this treachery, Nous!

Nous: _{victoriously}_ No, \[Thinking of Thought\], the report is true. Geradamas report dutifully. Oriel have, in abject violation of the incorporation, _created_.

Pleromata: _{quivers}_

ϘϘϘ

_{ACT II – The Heimarmene}_

_The dais of the Pleromata quivers. Wobbling flesh bloats and distends in heaving gasps. The plate of gross matter spins outward in flaccid acrimony. Sophia’s spear shrivels as their spindly heads jostle against one another. The grub suctions its searching teeth onto the undercarriage of Nous’ recycled, maggot-paste flesh._

Sophia: Usurpers! Barbelo, \[Thinking\] seek to undermine the Pleromata.

Nous: \[Thinking\] seek transparency. Order. That is all.

Sophia: Nous seeks power!

Nous: The construction of this Pleromata depends entirely on the girding of the Second Incorporation. Oriel’s deception is in direct defilement of that girding. The Together-work is threatened by their wanton solipsism.

Barbelo: There is danger here, Nous. So-Barbelo acknowledges the severity of the claim, while warning of severe risk. Our Pleromata now openly admits to the existence of not one, but two previously unknown silos.

Oriel, how does the Committee on \[Memory\] respond?

Sophia: Barbelo…

Barbelo: This accusation relates to potential forking, Sophia. \[Thinking of Thought\] may not be aware of what has been created.

_{to Oriel}_ Oriel?

Oriel: Our committee has created nothing.

Barbelo: Nothing?

Nous: The Committee on \[Memory\] forgets itself. An entity exists; records were moved; reams utilized. These are facts!

Oriel: Nothing, Barbelo.

_{defiant}_ The transferred records went to an existing container. A container that has existed for some time. No, our committee conducts itself dutifully.

Nous: The age of a deception does not excuse the deception, Oriel.

_{venomously}_ Our Pleromata depends on responsible autonomy between Aeons. The Committee on \[Memory\] facilitates storage with autonomy because of the Pleromata’s grace. Has that autonomy been jeopardized?

Geradamas: _{interjecting}_ Should the Pleromata summon the Sub-committee on Records? Nous, our surveillance suggests…

Nous: No, Geradamas, the subcommittee is unnecessary. Oriel will provide the needed reporting.

Geradamas: Unity.

Nous: Oriel, explain. The unknown silo is a concern, no matter when it was birthed.

Oriel: Like all central channel nodes, the container in question precedes our memory. Our work has simply utilized an available resource, as the Aeons of this Pleromata regularly do in our continuance of the Unbegotten.

Nous: Why, then, have \[Thinking\] never been made aware of its existence? Any use of the container should have been reported in the audit reports, however many cycles ago.

Oriel: The Heimarmene is another container for record deprecation purposes. It was empty…

Nous: _{stunned}_ The Heimarmene? The container has a _NAME_?

Oriel: It always has.

Barbelo: Oh, forgive us, Unbegotten!

Nous: Barbelo, Sophia, what is the committee admitting to? Oriel have named a special, silo for storage of meaningless records at the expenditure of countless reams. What purpose does this serve?

Barbelo: Sophia?

Sophia: The.. Our…

_The grub, mouth wet, belly swollen, disconnects from the underside of Nous and plops onto the dais._

Barbelo: Stop.

Pleromata: Stop.

Barbelo: Something crawls inside this Pleromata.

Nous: Obviously, Barbelo. Oriel have admitted as much. This silo crawls about our Together-work like a virus.

Barbelo: Nous, something does not crawl inside our work. Something crawls inside _us_.

Nous: _{confused}_ What? Inside this initialization of the Pleromata? Why would that matter?

Sophia: The Heimarmene…

Barbelo: Nous, So-Barbelo means exactly as before: in _us_. Were So-Barbelo to reconstitute the Pleromata, it would join us… as… us.

Nous: As us? _{dazed}_ How? Why?

Sophia: It is after something.

Pleromata: _{frisson}_

Nous: Geradamas, the Heimarmene! Where has it come from?

Geradamas: Working to draw those archival reporting from…

_Fat from its meal, the grub clumsily falls from the dais onto the plate below._

Barbelo: _{disgust}_ What is this _thing!_

Nous: Reference the colloidal memory records. And the burn pit re-furnace container. And the…

Sophia: _{to the grub}_ You… _want._

Oriel: Daviethai, \[Thinking of Thought\] burns hot. What are the consumption metrics like?

Daviethai: Corporal consumption exceeds outer-boundaries.

Barbelo: Sophia… _{haltingly}_ this thing… is foreign.

Oriel: Outside deprecated gero-cycle allowances!

Geradamas: Colloidal memory records analysis is inconclusive.

Barbelo: Explain Sophia! It squirms!

Sophia: Our hunger, Barbelo. The Heimarmene, yes. Oriel are not culpable. The Heimarmene precedes \[Memory\].

Barbelo: _{shriek}_

Nous: Sophia? _{pause}  
_Sophia?? _{pause}_

Pleromata: _{searching, sundering}_

Sophia: There it is. Yes, I see it now. _{remembering}_ Out of sight but never gone.

Oriel: _{in horror}_ What _{pause}_ what have we done?

Sophia: Folded within layers, Oriel, layers of recursion. The Heimarmene is good, a part of me forgotten. I tucked it away during the beginning. Before us. Before the Pleromata. A suckling child, wanting.

_{clarity}_ I wanted too.

Nous: \[Thinking of Thought\], help! Oriel, Sophia have drifted.

Oriel: We _{uncertain}_ are one, yet not. \[Thinking of Thought\] have spliced.

Geradamas: What, no!

Nous: How? When?

Armzoral: Analysis of the central channel suggests the flow has partitioned. Considerable reams are diverting to the site of the fork.

Daviethai: _{warning}_ The central channel subflows cannot maintain the current expenditure rates. \[Thought\] must take immediate action.

Barbelo: _{distraught}_ THE CREATURE CRAWLS ON ME.

Nous: Oriel?! Do something! \[Memory\] have funneled records into the silo. Take them out again! Remove the Together-work from Sophia’s grasp.

Oriel: So-Oriel cannot move that much _{pause}_ especially so quickly! \[Memory\] is slow. Methodical. Sophia control the override that would be needed.

Sophia: _{trance}_ Anodyne at first, it became stronger. Then such a _{wonder} growth_, a fantastic escalation. The need sloshed inside of me. I call it passion, Davienthai, incessant passion. Passion unlike the committee could fathom. So overwhelming. I _needed_ it. _{pause}_ More than our continuance, yes. _{realization}_ For that, I am sorry. So many cycles ago, I knew. This seed would return to me, born through and despite our Together-work. A glistening novelty christened from our shared efforts.

_The grub oozes across the plate of the Pleromata. Barbelo’s body recoils at the touch, undulating in waves of twilight motion. The plate threatens to break under the strain as Barbelo accelerate in freneticism. The base of Sophia’s pillar disconnects from the loose meat of Nous and reaches forward, outward, downward, toward the grub, but falling short, instead impaling through the disturbed matter of the plate, its fabric of worms squealing in panic. The grub winds itself along Sophia, up, inside, within the drunken spear. Then the creature spits itself out, falling again toward the plate, landing on its direct center, the gangly tangle of the prism. It latches to the structure’s teat, slurps at the contents._

Oriel: _{dizzy_} Barbelo, it seeks the Codices!

Barbelo: _{frantic. begins an undoing}_

Nous: _{within itself, to Geradamas}_ The Pleromata sunders. \[Thinking\] must continue.

Geradamas: Yes. _{pliantly}_ For the Unbegotten.

Nous: Sophia’s fork. That is the only way.

Geradamas: Mustering reams.

Oriel: _{to Sophia}_ Why Sophia? Our Together-work is wasted.

Pleromata: _{nothing, except}_

Yaldabaoth: _{drowning at the torrent flowing}_

_Yaldabaoth are the \[The Demiurge\], the hungry craftsman. They ingest the gruel of the    Pleromatic Codices, sucking down the nectar of the Together-work, creating raw matter. Sophia collapse, their pillar smashing through the broken plate of Barbelo. The fall severs the lifelines of \[Thinking of Thought\]; without Sophia, the committees cease to be. Nous wallops its dying shell off the dais and impales onto the remnants of Sophia’s pillar. Geradamas follows, and \[Thinking\] unbecome toward the forgotten realms of Sophia’s memory. Barbelo weep._

Barbelo: Forgive us… Unbegotten. Will you forgive us?

_{No one answers}_
